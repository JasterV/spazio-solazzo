## Ideas

- Users should probably also input their phone numbers so they can be called by someone from Mojo to confirm the booking

- Mojo will have an admin account with a panel to see reserves for all 3 spaces
  - They will be able to see a list of the bookings and filter by date and name
  - For each booking, they can confirm or cancel it

- Mojo should be able to update available slots for the week for each space

## Extra

- At some point, use AI to transform the PLAN.md files into documentation for developers
- It would be useful to let users make the membership card online
