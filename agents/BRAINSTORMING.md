## Ideas

- Mojo will have an admin account with a panel to see reserves for all 3 spaces
  - They will be able to see a list of the bookings and filter by date and name
  - For each booking, they can confirm or cancel it

- Mojo should be able to update available slots for the week for each space

- For every space there can be events happening on certain dates and times. 

- Administrators should be able to insert new events and for that time the time slots should be blocked for that specific space.

- In a future there might be spaces that do not need booking.

- Users should be able to chat about their booking with Mojo in a booking dedicated page.

- We need to put images about the spaces, descriptions & aprox prices of each booking

- Add telemetry to understand how users use the website.

- Administrators should be able to lock a timeslot for an asset if someone comes on the fly.

- For the coworking space, instead of selecting first the table and then time slot, users should be able to select first a time slot and then see available tables.

## Extra

- At some point, use AI to transform the PLAN.md files into documentation for developers
- It would be useful to let users make the membership card online
