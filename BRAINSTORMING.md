## Next

- Mojo will have an admin account with a panel to see reserves for all 3 spaces
  - They will be able to see a list of the bookings and filter by date, email and space.
  - For each booking, they can confirm or cancel it

- The admin panel will also have a view to create walk-in bookings for the co-working space.
  - It makes sense that admins have a separate panel to create walk-in bookings instead of reusing same UI that users use,
    because in the future, when users will have accounts, the booking flow won't ask them anymore for all their data.
    But for walk-in bookings, admins should always introduce all the data required from the user.

- The admin panel should have a way to switch between tools: The booking management tool, walk-in booking tool and space time availability tool

- Admins have to be able to login, if possible in a password-less way.

- Fill the page with the correct data for each space & time slots and deploy.

## Ideas

- Mojo should be able to update available slots for the week for each space

- For every space there can be events happening on certain dates and times. 

- Administrators should be able to insert new events and for that time the time slots should be blocked for that specific space.

- In a future there might be spaces that do not need booking.

- Users should be able to chat about their booking with Mojo in a booking dedicated page.

- Add telemetry to understand how users use the website.

- Administrators should be able to lock a timeslot for an asset if someone comes on the fly.

- For the coworking space, instead of selecting first the table and then time slot, users should be able to select first a time slot and then see available tables.

## Extra

- At some point, use AI to transform the PLAN.md files into documentation for developers
- It would be useful to let users make the membership card online
