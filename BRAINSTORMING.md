## Required next

- Users have to validate their booking with a code sent to their email, otherwise the booking can't be confirmed

- Time slots should be configurable for each day of the week, for example on sundays we might want to close or saturdays might have less available hours, as well as tuesdays for the jam room

## Ideas

- Users should probably also input their phone numbers so they can be called by someone from Mojo to confirm the booking

- Mojo will have an admin account with a panel to see reserves for all 3 spaces
  - They will be able to see a list of the bookings and filter by date and name
  - For each booking, they can confirm or cancel it

- Mojo should be able to update available slots for the week for each space

## Extra

- At some point, use AI to transform the PLAN.md files into documentation for developers
- It would be useful to let users make the membership card online
